# micros-multi
 This exercise will walk you through the process of building a microservice application that was not designed to run on Power. 
 It was created six years ago by a third-party monitoring enterprise (Weave Works) and made available to be used in demos and trainings 
 and was originally created to run on an x86 platform.
